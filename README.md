## Motivation
A security control room brings together the elements of a security operation and offers a logical way to coordinate the effects of security systems, personnel and responseoptions. A security control roomcontaining monitoring and controlsystems can commonly be found in:
* Universities, Hotels, Banks, Shopping Malls, Industrial sites, Airports, Ports.

I suggest implementing the same capabilities but in a virtual way, and saving place, money, and equipment. you can find the full project proposal [here](References/ProjectProposal.pdf).
